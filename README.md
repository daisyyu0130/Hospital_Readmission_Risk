2. Data linkage (DAD, NARCS, MSP)
3. Extract Table A variables (e.g., most responsible diagnosis, medical history, medications)
4. Create Table A (patient characteristics)
5. Define response variable
6. Apply propensity score weighting
7. calculate intra-class correlation
8. Perform backward selection
9. Conduct primary and secondary analyses
10. Conduct subgroup analyses
11. Create Table E (sensitivity analysis)
12. Create Table B (physician characteristics)
13. Conduct cost analysis
14. Sensitivity analysis: discharge to long-term care
15. Sensitivity analysis: episode of care
16. Cite relevant R packages
